## Project Rules
- Developer documentation for this project lives in `src/main/java/frc/robot/docs`.
- All methods created should include Javadocs so IntelliSense in VS Code shows relevant information.
- When asked to commit, add an appropriate commit message for the staged changes, if the user didn't supply one.
- When appropriate, ask if commits should be split into related, granular commits.
